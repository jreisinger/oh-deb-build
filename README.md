oh-deb-build
============

Creates deb package with supplied build number. This is used mostly when packages are build automatically (when the build number is not known before commit), but is autogenerated by build server like Jenkins.

expected directory structure is
<pre>
- DEBIAN
    - control
    - ...
- debian
    - ...
</pre>

Where <b>DEBIAN</b> directory has to have at least control file. If the control
file contains a variable ${BUILD_NUMBER} ex: Version: 0.1-${BUILD_NUMBER}
it will be replaced for supplied build number.

Other files (postinst, prerm ...) in DEBIAN directory can use any of these variables: ${PACKAGE}, ${VERSION}, ${ARCHITECTURE}, which will be replaced for values found in control file.

<b>debian</b> directory should contain files that will be packaged as deb.

- uses <i>dpkg-deb --build</i> command to build package
